    "text": "Hypothesis: Are high rates of screen time on a hand-held device during elementary school years associated with a high probability of ADHD-like symptoms?\n\n\n\nIn recent years, a high rate of interest and concern over attention deficits surrounding device usage has emerged. The concern stems from the idea that increased incidences of ADHD-like symptoms such as lack of patience, impulse control, and focus are due to rising screen time experienced as adolescents. This study is NOT a rigid study on the probabilities of an individual having a diagnoses of ADHD (although we think similar directionalities will be found). This study has a flexible definition to mean ADHD-like symptoms, so as to also include people exhibiting symptoms very similar to ADHD, but perhaps is either undiagnosed or falls out of the medical definition of ADHD. The best method, based on previous experience, is to do a logistic regression, classifying people into two classes for the output: 1) high-instances of ADHD symptoms and 2) low-instances of ADHD symptoms. My methods are typically data modeling based because of my recent experience.  \n\n\nThe data to be sourced should be in service of a uniform quantitative metrics or scale assessing the extent of the participants’ attention deficits. We can accomplish this with survey data about each observation’s attention deficit prior to the study, then again 10 years later after the study. The inputs are total weekly screen time scraped from historical Apple data during the ages between 5 and 11 and additionally the weekly amount of screen time devoted to certain activities such as social media, texting, streaming, video games, etc. \n\n\nBased on my personal experience so far with parametric modeling procedures, I would pursue logistic regression with theoretical implications. In doing so, I anticipate higher probabilities associated with participants using their devices for more kinds of activities as well as those with higher total averages than their counterparts. Participants who already score high on ADHD like symptoms cannot be considered for participation. One or more  samples ending with a minimum of 1500 elementary aged American children would be sufficient for our purposes. \n\n\nDuring exploratory data analysis, data visualization (univariate, bivariate) relationships will be examined and transformed as needed. We will need to examine various tests on residuals and interaction terms to test nested models and model validity. \n\n\nTo start the project, we must approach the proper entities of authority to complete due diligence with ethical procedures surrounding human subjects. We must find funding for the project from the most relevant stakeholders."

    "text": "This is a comparative literature review between Leo Breiman’s paper “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” and Galit Shmueli’s piece “To Explain or to Predict?”\n\n\nIn 2001, Berkeley professor Leo Breiman wrote a seminole paper in which he convincingly advocates for the growth of the algorithm culture over the data modeling culture due to the trade off between interpretability and accuracy. Breiman argues algorithmic culture is a different caliber that demands more focus. Understanding what happens in the black box is marginally less important than the potential of its applied knowledge. Thus, algorithmic processes are less discriminatory and enable better knowledge mining than data modeling. He provides several examples of how its methods often precede improved accuracy, relative to data modeling methods. Data modeling, reasoned Breiman, had become too limited by its underlying assumptions such as its demands for theoretical relationships and interpretability. How to improve efficiency, how to improve greenhouse gas emissions, how to detect extreme weather events, any outcome-oriented goals are - or were - the pressing reasons to re-prioritize the two cultures. \n9 years later, author of “To Explain or to Predict?” by Galit Schmueli brings an updated  perspective to the table. Both authors agree a cultural gap resulted in two distinct modeling rationales which has led to data modeling culture’s narrowing breadth of knowledge extraction. In contrast to Breiman, he does not advocate for one culture’s rigor or survival over the other. By the time of his publication, a significant number of practices shared between the two cultures are identifiable. Thus, the two are not as rigidly defined. For example, traces of model validity and use commonly interchangeable tools such as partitioning and visualization. However, the tools are worked in different fashions, as led by the a priori project needs. Though he agrees a considerable gap remains (in four aspects) between the two cultures, algorithm modeling has caught up or even supersedes data modeling’s practicality in many regards. \n\nIn fact, Schmeuli argues the bridge to divide the knowledge gap should go both ways. The use of algorithmic modeling techniques have earned their place in research science and should not be limited to the specific spaces already associated with it. The ultimate pursuit of science demands so. The innovative methods and growth of algorithmic culture improve upon data modeling practices and the reverse is also true. The underlying wisdom of data modeling has more knowledge to impart to the bleeding edge of algorithmic culture.  \n\nAll in all, the two papers are emblematic of the state of affairs in their respective eras. The evolution of data science is a story about humans urgently adapting through iterative sciences with the singular goal of gaining useful knowledge. How “useful knowledge” is defined seems to largely hinge on how one values the scale between prediction and interpretability. \n1/31/2023 Libby Smith"
